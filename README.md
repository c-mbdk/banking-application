# banking-application

## About this project
This project was created to consolidate Java fundamentals, or more accurately, implementing programming fundamentals in Java. The essence of this application is a banking application. The user can view their balance, withdraw money, deposit money and exit the application. The application also prevents the user from withdrawing money if they do not have sufficient funds. 

The application uses:
- a custom BankAccount class (mixture of private fields, private methods and public methods)
- the NumberFormat instance for currency formatting
- input from the user to control the flow
- switch case
- if/else

## Future enhancements
Currently, this application does not store information in any database - the information stored/referenced in variables is no longer available once the application closes. The next logical enhancement is to connect this to a database. This could also be made into a desktop application or web application.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository/download the files.
2. Run the Main.java file in the application of your choice e.g., Command Prompt, IntelliJ etc
